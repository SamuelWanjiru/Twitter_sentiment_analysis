## What is sentiment analysis?

Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea. It involves the use of data mining, machine learning and artificial intelligence to mine text for sentiment and subjective information.

Sentiment analysis systems help organizations gather insights from unorganized and unstructured text that comes from online sources such as emails, blog posts, support tickets, web chats, social media channels, forums and comments. Algorithms replace manual data processing by implementing rule-based, automatic or hybrid methods. Rule-based systems perform sentiment analysis based on predefined, lexicon-based rules while automatic systems learn from data with machine learning techniques. A hybrid sentiment analysis combines both approaches. In addition to identifying sentiment, opinion mining can extract the polarity (or the amount of positivity and negativity), subject and opinion holder within the text. Furthermore, sentiment analysis can be applied to varying scopes such as document, paragraph, sentence and sub-sentence levels.

## Types of sentiment analysis

Fine-grained sentiment analysis provides a more precise level of polarity by breaking it down into further categories, usually very positive to very negative. This can be considered the opinion equivalent of ratings on a 5-star scale. Emotion detection identifies specific emotions rather than positivity and negativity. Examples could include happiness, frustration, shock, anger and sadness. Intent-based analysis recognizes actions behind a text in addition to opinion. For example, an online comment expressing frustration about changing a battery could prompt customer service to reach out to resolve that specific issue. Aspect-based analysis gathers the specific component being positively or negatively mentioned. For example, a customer might leave a review on a product saying the battery life was too short. Then, the system will return that the negative sentiment is not about the product as a whole, but about the battery life.
